**Cloud & DevOps | Infrastructure Automation | AWS | Containers | Observability**

I am a Cloud & DevOps Engineer with 5+ years of experience designing, deploying, and supporting secure infrastructure across on-prem and cloud environments. I specialize in automation, infrastructure-as-code, containerization, and scalable system design. I have a strong background in Windows/Linux administration, VMware, Azure, and SaaS platforms — now transitioning that skillset toward AWS-native, containerized, and production-grade DevOps architectures.
