**Cloud & DevOps | Linux + AWS Infrastructure | Containers | Automation | Observability**

Turning deep, hands-on experience in Linux, Networking, Virtualization, and Cloud into production-grade deployments across EC2, Docker, VPC, SSL, CI/CD, monitoring pipelines, and full-stack microservices.

---

##  Core Competencies

###  Linux Systems

- Daily-driver Linux practitioner: shell scripting, systemd, journald, permissions, users/groups, sudo, SSH, logs
- Built services from scratch: Nginx, Docker daemon, firewall rules, iptables/NAT, system resource monitoring
- Hands-on with process lifecycle, load/CPU/memory analysis, sockets, ports, and OS-level networking
- Strong understanding of OSI layers, packet flow, veth pairs, bridges, namespaces, VXLAN (overlay), DNS resolution
- Applied Linux-first thinking in all DevOps projects (EC2 hardening, container networking, SSL, log pipelines)

###  Cloud & Infrastructure (AWS)

- Designed & deployed secure multi-AZ VPCs with public/private subnets, IGW, NAT, routing, NACLs & SG architecture
- Built EC2-based Docker host clusters with ALB (HTTPS/ACM), Route 53 domain routing, and autoscaling patterns
- Experience across Azure AD/Entra, AVD, DNS, DHCP, Conditional Access, Group Policy, CA setup
- Migrated workloads from on-prem VMware ESXi to cloud-ready architectures

###  Containerization, Orchestration & Deployment

- Dockerized full MERN microservices, multi-container stacks with Nginx reverse proxy + round-robin load balancing
- Deep understanding of container networking: docker0, bridge, custom networks, port mapping, NAT flow, overlay
- Implemented CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Jenkins (build → test → dockerize → deploy pipelines)
- Moving toward ECS/EKS with strong fundamentals in namespaces, cgroups, images, volumes, and registry workflows

###  Networking & Security

- Real-world routing/NAT/VLAN/VXLAN knowledge: built packet-level labs using namespaces + veth + bridges
- Configured SSL/TLS end-to-end: CloudFront/ACM → ALB → Nginx → app containers
- Implemented RD Gateway dual-NIC architecture for secure access in isolated private networks
- Strong IAM fundamentals: least privilege, roles, access boundaries, auditing, patching, backup posture

###  Monitoring, Observability & RMM

- Experience with ConnectWise Automate, Grafana, CloudWatch metrics/alarms, and log/telemetry collection
- Built correlation-ID based logging pipelines (ALB → Nginx → Node containers)
- Implemented patch baselines, backup integrity checks, endpoint automation
- Used Liongard for visibility, configuration intelligence, and compliance reporting

###  DevOps Tooling, Scripting & API Automation

- PowerShell + Bash scripting for provisioning, auditing, cleanup, and automation workflows
- Hands-on experience with JSON/JMESPath transformations for Liongard + API integrations
- Implemented startup scripts, health checks, cron tasks, and zero-downtime deployment logic

###  SaaS Intelligence Platform (Liongard) Exposure for 2 years

- Automated MSP ops across AD, DNS, SSL, M365, Azure, firewalls, and endpoints
- Built dashboards using Liongard API + JMESPath to deliver deep insights
- Created compliance/risk workflows, SOPs, RCAs, and onboarding frameworks
- Enabled multiple clients to achieve configuration visibility and operational maturity
